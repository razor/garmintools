          WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INADVERTENTLY 
          ERASE ALL DATA STORED IN THE GARMIN

Because of confusion and misinformation on the newsgroup,  I have 
asked Garmin Engineering to give us a consensus view of how the 
accuracy and operation of the G-12XL (and other Garmin equipment
can be affected by operating the factory test mode while in view
of  "real" satellites.  In my view,   the  significance  of  the
"problem" is minimal  since calibration points are automatically
restored when the unit is operated locked to SVs the next time(s).
The Garmin answer follows:

The answer from Garmin Engineering Follows:

Joe,

Some one  did talk to Jay on the phone.   I guess the answer  was 
not  clear  to him.  What was said to Dr. Reid  in  the  original 
email  to  him (who altered it and then posted it  (Garmin  never 
posted this information))  was that by operating the unit in test 
mode, AND locking on to a specific satellite,   you would destroy 
the unit's oscillator compensation curve AT THE TEMPERATURE WHERE 
THE  LOCK OCCURS.   Perhaps destroy is a bad word, it does  sound 
somewhat permanent. In fact,  it WILL NOT damage the unit in  any 
way,   but  will  erase the  oscillator  temperature  calibration 
point.   It  would  appear that some have  interpreted  it  as  a 
permanent  degradation  of  the units performance.  For  that  we 
apologize.  That is NOT correct.

Accuracy  was  never  an issue. The only issue at  stake  is  the 
ability  of  the unit to lock on to satellites  and  calculate  a 
position.

As  we  know  from GPS 101,  A GPS  receiver  must  be  precisely 
synchronized  with  the satellites to operate. We must  know  the 
exact time the signal left the satellite, and the time the signal 
arrived  at  the receiver, to calculate the time  difference  and 
corresponding  range  to the satellite.  By knowing  the  precise 
location  of  the satellite when the signal left, and  the  range 
(pseudorange), we know our exact distance from that satellite (at 
that  point in time). By performing this calculation on  multiple 
satellites, we can triangulate and calculate our position. 

Obviously,  timimg is everything. We must have a  precise  timing 
source  for this to work. We could install a rubidium  or  cesium 
beam oscillator in our GPS receivers, but this would be a  little 
pricey,  use  a lot more battery power, and the unit would  be  a 
little bulky. Instead, we use a relatively cheap oscillator,  and 
a  lot  of software finesse.   Oscillator  compensation  data  is 
stored  in the unit as a table based upon temperature.  When  the 
unit  locks  on, it calculates the unit's  oscillator  error  and 
enters  a  correction factor into this table based  upon  current 
internal  temperature.  In this fashion the  unit  is  CONSTANTLY 
"learning"  and fine tuning itself. We burn these units  in  when 
new  to  calculate  and store calibration  constants  across  the 
entire rated temperature range of the product.

What  Darrin and the previous Email tried to explain, perhaps  in 
different  tones, was that running the GPS 12XL, or other  GARMIN 
units,  in  test  mode, would mis-calibrate  the  units  internal 
oscillator if the unit locked onto the same satellite it  expects 
to  see  in the factory environment when connected  to  a  signal 
generator.  The amount of mis-calibration depends on  where  this 
particular  satellite happens to be in the sky. If the  satellite  
is  low on the horizon and heading directly towards or away  from 
you, there will be significant doppler shift on the signal  which 
in turn will grossly mis-calibrate our oscillator. This would  be 
worst-case and statistically rare.

The  net  effect of this type of mis-calibration may  range  from 
long  acquisition  times to, on rare  circumstances,  failure  to 
acquire at all.

If the latter occurs, as Darrin pointed out, the user can put the 
unit  into Autolocate mode, which ignores oscillator  calibration 
and  the  unit will lock on and begin to  repair  the  correction 
table for each temperature it experiences. Of course,  some users 
might  not know to put the unit into Autolocate mode,   they  may 
see  the  unit not locking onto satellites and believe it  to  be 
malfunctioning.

As soon as the unit locks on, oscillator calibration is performed 
and  peak  accuracy  is  immediately  restored.  Of  course,  for 
complete  repair,  the  unit will need to be locked  on  to  real 
satellites  for  each temperature point that the  unit  was  mis-
calibrated to.

Darrin  and I do not disagree on any points. He was  stating  his 
perspecive  from a designers point of view, and I am  giving  you 
mine  from the standpoint that we don't want anyone to erase  the 
calibration from his unit.
